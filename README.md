pynergy.py
==============

```sh
usage: pynergy.py [-h] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] -e ENERGY [-d DELTA] [-g]
```

![](bands.png)

This script calculates transition energies between energy bands using
eigen-energy files generated by ABINIT during a band structure calculation.
This script allows you to input a desired energy value and finds all the
upward transitions that can produce that value within a specified tolerance.

It can output Gnuplot arrow codes for plotting or descriptive text for each
transition.

You can generate the sample output with 

```
./pynergy.py -i sample_in -o sample_out -e 6.81 -d 0.001
```

A good gnuplot arrow style can be
```
set style arrow 3 head linetype 1 linecolor rgb "#000" linewidth 1.5 size screen 0.01,7,90
```

To-Do
--------
* Add in conversion functionality in pure python to go from raw ABINIT
files to Gnuplot-friendly input.
* For Gnuplot arrows, filter out duplicate lines.
* Add probability factors for different transitions.
* Print out sample gnuplot arrow style.
